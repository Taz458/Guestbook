This project was probably the most challeging one so far. I found it hard to grasp the concepts of servers and databses
in such a short period of time, and there were so many little bugs/problems with depolyemnt to render, connecting to the
supabase etc. However, in debugging these problems I learned a lot quickly, I had to keep breaking it down and starting
over and over again. 

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
All of the normal requirements, and I also added a delete button for a stretch goal. I also made it visually impressive (for me at least!).

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Some stretch goals. 

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Purely time and energy. I've been very ill this week aswell which has made it really hard to focus.

At the start I essentailly just used the DEMOS and moodle workshops as a guide to get the ball rolling. I used CHATGPT to walk me
through the code in the DEMOS to explain simply and in detail what each bit does which really helped, and I watched a youtube video on
express and node.

I felt I was just copying the demos and not understanding it, but now I feel I have a much better understanding
of setting up a database, then a server to query the databse and return it in JSON format, and a client to get the data, which was the
same as when we were fetching from APIs. It's like now we bascically create our own APIs!
